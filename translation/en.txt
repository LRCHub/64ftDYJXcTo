[00:01.18] Even if I think about it, I won't understand.
[00:02.89] Under the blue sky, I waited for you
[00:04.99] At noon when the wind blew, imagining slipping away from the afternoon
[00:08.29] Hey, I wonder what's going to happen from here on out.
[00:10.62] I'm not being taught how to proceed.
[00:12.73] I looked into your eyes And walked on without saying a word
[00:21.23] 
[00:31.78] Even if I think about it, I won't understand.
[00:33.65] Youth is boring anyway.
[00:35.45] I quit piano, yet I still can't shake the habit of tapping my desk.
[00:39.11] Hey, I wonder what we'll be doing in the future.
[00:41.39] I hope you're not playing music.
[00:44.62] Don't worry about it.
[00:47.62] Even if I draw a line in my heart
[00:46.58] 
[00:54.45] It just wouldn't go away What's the point now?
[00:57.92] Hey, don't bring it up again.
[01:02.92] You're wrong.
[01:01.71] 
[01:03.12] You guys humans just don't get it.
[01:05.69] Truth, love, the world, suffering, life—I don't care about any of it.
[01:09.47] Wanting to know if it's right is also a defense mechanism.
[01:13.35] I thought about it. It's your fault.
[01:19.85] 
[01:31.24] I can't figure it out no matter how much I think about it, but I really don't want to grow old.
[01:35.11] Just thinking about dying someday makes my chest feel hollow.
[01:39.05] I wonder what I'll be doing in the future.
[01:40.80] I finally understood when I grew up.
[01:44.28] I haven't done anything.
[01:47.78] I hate people with happy faces
[01:46.06] 
[01:53.98] How should I make peace with it?
[01:55.84] The unfulfilled depths of my mind
[02:00.08] Monster-like inferiority complex
[02:05.08] You're not wrong.
[02:03.02] Hey, no matter what, you guys are human.
[02:04.55] 
[02:07.16] Love, salvation, kindness—the idea that none of them have any basis is creepy.
[02:10.92] Even finding love songs painful is a defense mechanism.
[02:14.66] Whatever. It's your fault.
[02:22.16] 
[02:32.75] Even if I think about it, I won't understand.
[02:34.53] Just living is painful enough.
[02:36.68] Music doesn't make money anyway.
[02:38.54] Lyrics or whatever, it's fine.
[02:43.69] I don't care.
[02:47.69] You're not wrong, are you?
[02:47.42] 
[02:51.34] I'm not wrong, right?
[02:55.38] I'm not wrong, right?
[02:59.38] 
[03:08.55] You're wrong. I know it.
[03:10.83] You humans too
[03:12.53] Truth, love, salvation, kindness, life—none of it matters.
[03:16.28] Not being able to give the right answer is also a defense mechanism.
[03:20.15] Whatever. It's your fault.
[03:27.65] 
[03:40.15] I had my own convictions too.
[03:41.87] Now it's just a fleeting thought
[03:43.82] I wrote about you over and over
[03:45.51] What really mattered wasn't whether it sold or not.
[03:49.11] It's true. It really is. That's how it used to be.
[03:57.61] So I
[03:54.84] 
[03:58.56] That's why I quit music.
